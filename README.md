# USHS-Housing-Portal <!-- omit from toc -->

A web application built for [Union Station Homeless Services (USHS)](https://unionstationhs.org/), a nonprofit organization committed to helping homeless individuals and families rebuild their lives in the San Gabriel Valley. This web app aims to centralize and streamline the everyday workflows of the USHS team: collecting landlord/unit information, browsing housing unit data, referring renter candidates, and tracking the status of the renter candidate process.

**Built with:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/), [Bun](https://react.dev/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
